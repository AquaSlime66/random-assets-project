        <h1>Asset Portfolio Description</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome wanderers, from near, familiar places, hubs of great trade to the far 
            inhospitable depths of the Wasteland. This site is set up to display several items 
            I've gathered throughout the years. These trinkets and oddities originate anywhere form
            the most mundane locations, to strange and foreign lands. Some of these items
            have uncountable values, relics of a lost age, others sold and bartered
            for entire empires, and some, well some aren't exactly abounding in value, 
            but are just plain interesting.
        </p>
<!--the tab for these paragraphs should be referenced in the CSS-->
<!--maybe use the background webmp file OR the books pile for the background of this monitor?-->
        <p>
            Some of these items come from various trips and travels I've been on with 
            family members and friends. Some of them are digital items, mostly from the
            video game Fallout 76 (I'm not one of those NFT 'people'). Some people are willing
            to spend ridiculous amounts of money on digital weapons, cosmetics, or random 
            other oddities.

            These are just a few items I've gathered from various corners of
            the globe. Each item will have it's respective original price, whether
            that price was a foreign currency, or a digital one. 
            It will also list its place of orgin, and personal meaning, if one exists.
