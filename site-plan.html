      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase several assets and oddities, with their respective prices, possible means of acquisition and how they came under my ownership. Not everything is necessarily valuble, some are just pretty sick oddities.  
        These range from physical items I've picked up everywhere from yard sales to foriegn countries, and digital items from a few video games, like Fallout 76.
        I'd like to inform people of the possible value of random items, and maybe help them keep a closer eye out, whether for their own items or just knowledge wise.
      </p>  <!-- change this   For the prices, I'll try to credit various websites that i've used in the past to pricecheck-->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be a few online friends for Fallout 76 items, with friends and family as the audience of the physical assets. Several of 
        my online friends have spent significant amounts of money on Fallout 76 (although I don't), so they would definitely be interested in possibly buying or just 
        viewing said items. As for the physical items, like I said, they mostly come from trips (or the side of the road) and my family/friends have been present 
        for the majority of these travels. I've also considered re-vamping this website after the class into something I could actually put on a resume. Instead of a being
        something rather dumb like this, I'd change it into a showcase of different trips and vacations, showing off pictures and souvenirs from them.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
      <p>This change to a travel showcase website could happen midway through the project, but if it does (and that's and if) I'd alter the appropriate parts of the site.
        I also will add a background color (close to the primary color) meaning I'd also need to change some of the colors in the palette, or even add some to it.
