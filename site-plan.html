      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase several assets and oddities, with their respective prices, possible means of acquisition and how they came under my ownership. Not everything is necessarily valuble, some are just pretty sick oddities.  
        These range from physical items I've picked up everywhere from yard sales to foriegn countries, and digital items from a few video games, like Fallout 76.
        I'd like to inform people of the possible value of random items, and maybe help them keep a closer eye out, whether for their own items or just knowledge wise.
      </p>  <!-- change this   For the prices, I'll try to credit various websites that i've used in the past to pricecheck-->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be a few online friends for Fallout 76 items, with friends and family as the audience of the physical assets. Several of 
        my online friends have spent significant amounts of money on Fallout 76 (although I don't), so they would definitely be interested in possibly buying or just 
        viewing said items. As for the physical items, like I said, they mostly come from trips (or the side of the road) and my family/friends have been present 
        for the majority of these travels. I've also considered re-vamping this website after the class into something I could actually put on a resume. Instead of a being
        something rather dumb like this, I'd change it into a showcase of different trips and vacations, showing off pictures and souvenirs from them.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
      <p>This change to a travel showcase website could happen midway through the project, but if it does (and that's and if) I'd alter the appropriate parts of the site.
        I also will add a background color (close to the primary color) meaning I'd also need to change some of the colors in the palette, or even add some to it.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p><b>Intro Paragraph (Home Page)</b></p>
      <p>
        Welcome wanderers, from near and familar places, hubs of trade to the far inhospitable depths of the Wasteland. These pages are meant to display several items I've acquired over many years.
        These trinkets and oddities originate from the most mundane of locations, like a McDonalds parking lot, to the foreign and strange lands of new Jersey.
        Some curios have uncountable values, relics of a lost age, perhaps even a lost civilization... others sold and bartered for entire empires, and a few 
        don't exactly have such abounding value, but are just plain old interesting. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Asset Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>
        Each item will be evaluated based on it's orgin, rarity, accessability, and retrospective value, compared to similar items, if possible.
        Some sites to reference these prices include TCG, Gameflip, Bricklink, ebay, and Amazon (so far). Some items have more than possible value,
        but that will be explained when needed.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Actual Items (page 2)</h3>
      <p>These items I've gathered from various corners of the globe. Throughout the years, my family and friends have taken me (or vice versa)
        on many fun and distant vacations. 
        These entries on this page will describe a few details about them, and maybe even a short story.
        They will likely be displayed in a list format, once fully evaluated.
        More will also be added, later after formatting. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Item #1: McDonalds Order Tent #32 (subject to change)</b></p>
      <p>
        The orgins of this mysterious herald of warm cardboard are quite murky. I crossed paths with it sometime after a church youth dance.
        Possible Means of Obtaining: Stolen from your Local McDonalds, or bought online.
        My Method: Found in a McDonalds parking lot around 1:30 am, sometime in 2017.
        Value: ~ $15 (ebay)
        Paid Price: $0 (not stolen)
        Asset's Future: Very few of these tents are actually online, and McDonalds appears to slowly be phasing them out. The value is likely to go up
        , but I'd rather keep and display it. (make sure to space these out on the correct lines, maybe even as a structured list).
      </p>
      <p><b>Item #5: Aftermath Analyst (Magic Card)</b></p>
      <p>
        A great land grab card for a mill deck.
        Possible Means of Obtaining: Bought at a game store or online store.
        My Method: Bought on TCG, May 2024.
        Value: ~ $2 (TCG)
        Paid Price: $1.50
        Asset's Future: This is a endgame or midgame land grab card, and will always have a place in my Mothman deck.

      <h3>Fallout 76 Assets (page 3)</h3>
      <p>These are items gathered from online video games, and here I will try to explain why the item is so rare, or so valuable.</p>
      <p><b>Digital Item #1: Fasnacht Glowing Scorchbeast Mask</b></p>
      <p>
        A cool looking glowing mask.
        Possible Means of Obtaining: Bought online, traded in-game, obtained from Fasnacht Events since 2024.
        My Method: Completed Fasnacht Parade, mid Febuary 2024.
        Value: ~ $30 (Gameflip), 80,000 caps
        Paid Price: $0 
        Asset's Future: I have one or two of this mask, and although it does look cool, it's price will likely decrease once the event occurs again, so I might sell it soon.
      </p>
      <p><b>Digital Item #2: Anti-Armor Fixer</b></p>
      <p>The entire effect readout for this weapon is Anti-Armor, Faster Fire rate, -25 VATS drain.
        Possible Means of Obtaining: Bought online, traded in-game, or rolled in-game.
        My Method: Gift from a friend.
        Value: ~ $10 (Gameflip), ~ 25,000 caps
        Paid Price: $0 
        Asset's Future: This gun used to be highly sought after, but has since gone down in value. I would sell it, but a good friend gave it to me, 
        so I'll likely keep it.
