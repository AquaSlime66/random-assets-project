        <p>
            Now, the majority of these items are not really things I'd like to actually sell.
            In fact, most really don't have a ton of value to them, but more memories and
            just a coolness factor to them. They will still be price checked, to the best of my ability. 
            I'm a big souviner collector, and that's why I have most of these, picked up from 
            flea markets, road-side vendors, etc.

        <h1>McDonalds Order Tent #23</h1>
        <img src="images/tent.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            This item's got some good memories behind it. Sometime in 2017, I was 
            at a McDonalds after a stake dance, and we joked about stealing one of the 
            resturant's order tents. Now, we never actually did such a thing, but when we were 
            kicked out of the resturant (it was closing), we found a solidatary order tent, waiting
            patiently in the parking lot. I would've given it back to the resturant,
            but they were closed.

            <li>Date of Acquisition: 2017, around 1:30 am</li>
            <li>Acquisition Cost: Found (NOT stolen)</li>
            <li>Current Value: ~ $15 (eBay)</li>
            <li>Methods of Obtaining: buying online, working at a McDonalds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Item's Future: This really isn't worth a lot, espcially considering shipping it
            practically anywhere would cost more than what I'd make on it, and I'm just keeping it.

        <h1>LEGO Home One Mon Calamari Star Cruiser #7754</h1>
        <img src="images/home-one.png" alt="">
        <p>
            As a kid, this was my dream LEGO Star Wars set. It had everything, a docking bay for
            a ship, a command room, space for a million figures, a flipping Admiral Ackbar minifigure, everything.
            Unfortunately, in stores around 2010, the set retailed for around $100, and I was never getting it. However, 
            I did eventually find a killer deal on it, during the COVID lockdowns.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date of Acquisition: May 2022</li>
            <li>Acquisition Cost: $60, craigslist</li>
            <li>Current Value: ~ $140 (bricklink)</li>
            <li>Methods of Obtaining: buying online</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Item's Future: I don't really imagine this set going up past $150. While all its figures
            are exclusive, it isn't a high demand set, as several reprints of most figures
            have been made (aside from Crix Madine). I'm also just not going to sell it.
