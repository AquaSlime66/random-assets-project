                Now, the majority of these items are not really things I'd like to actually sell.
                In fact, most really don't have a ton of value to them, but more memories and
                just a coolness factor to them. They will still be price checked, to the best of my ability. 
                I'm a big souviner collector, and that's why I have most of these, picked up from 
                flea markets, road-side vendors, etc.

        <h1>McDonalds Order Tent #23</h1>

                This item's got some good memories behind it. Sometime in 2017, I was 
                at a McDonalds after a stake dance, and we joked about stealing one of the 
                resturant's order tents. Now, we never actually did such a thing, but when we were 
                kicked out of the resturant (it was closing), we found a solidatary order tent, waiting
                patiently in the parking lot. I would've given it back to the resturant,
                but they were closed.

                Item's Future: This tent really isn't worth a lot, especially considering that the price of shipping it would likely
                be close to the selling price. It's also something I've got good memories from, 
                so it's probably not going anywhere soon.

                As a kid, this was my dream LEGO Star Wars set. It had everything, a docking bay for
            a ship, a command room, space for a million figures, a flipping Admiral Ackbar minifigure, everything.
            Unfortunately, in stores around 2010, the set retailed for around $100, and I was never getting it. However, 
            I did eventually find a killer deal on it, during the COVID lockdowns.

                Item's Future: I don't really imagine this set going up past $150. While all its figures
            are exclusive, it isn't a high demand set, as several reprints of most figures
            have been made (aside from Crix Madine). I'm also just not going to sell it.
