        <h1>Fallout 76 Assets</h1>
        <p>
            Fallout 76 is the only multi-player Fallout game (at least 'playable'), and 
            has a evergrowing playerbase. This growth in players means more customers, and 
            like I said, people are more than willing to pay for some of these
            items. Each game covers different parts and eras of the same universe,
            a post-apocalyptic alternate version of out timeline, and the stories of
            those that survive. One of the currencies used in this universe, is bottle
            caps. Each bottle cap represents a cap full of water. Cap values will also be 
            list for those that, like me, don't want to spend money on the game.

        <h1>Anti-Armor Fixer</h1>
        <img src="images/fixer.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            The Fixer is a staple weapon of the wasteland. Medium ammo capacity,
            rapid fire rate, cheap ammo, decent range and above all, insane crit speeds.
            To translate that into English, it's a pretty good gun.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weapon's Effects: +50% Armor Penetration, +50% Critical Damage, and -25% Action Point Cost</li>
            <li>Date of Purchase (if any): Mid 2022</li>
            <li>Acquisition Cost: Gift from a friend</li>
            <li>Current Value: ~ $10 or 25,000 c (Gameflip)</li>
            <li>Methods of Obtaining: Bought online, traded in-game, rolled in-game</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Item's Future: Although the Fixer is a all-round great gun, it's signifcantly gone down
            in value over the years. It won't likely go over $15 in the future, but might be worth a good trade. 
            It was also a gift from a good friend, so I'm keeping it.

        <h1>Fasnacht Glowing Scorchbeast Mask</h1>
        <img src="images/mask.webp" alt="">
        <p>
            Fasnacht is a real-live event that takes place in the small town of Helvetia, and 
            Fallout 76's developers have made it a major staple of the game. Upon completion
            of the event, each participating player is given a mask, although at a very low chance, they can recieve
            a rare and cool looking mask. This is one of those, and although it offers no real-ingame
            advantages, it just looks cool, and it's rare.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date of Purchase (if any): Febuary 2024</li>
            <li>Acquisition Cost: Reward for completing Fasnacht</li>
            <li>Current Value: ~ $30 or 80,000 c (Gameflip)</li>
            <li>Methods of Obtaining: Bought online, traded in-game, recieved from the Fasnacht event</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Item's Future: Fasnacht Masks are a volatile element of Fallout 76's market, sometimes skyrocketing
            to insane prices ($150+) or settling at a healthy medium. This mask is likely to go down,
            so I may sell it soon, just to capatilize off of the current value, and the liklihood to decrease in the near future.
