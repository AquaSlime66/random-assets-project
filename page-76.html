            <h1>Fallout 76 Assets</h1>
            <p>
                Fallout 76 is the only multi-player Fallout game (at least 'playable'), and 
                has a evergrowing playerbase. This growth in players means more customers, and 
                like I said, people are more than willing to pay for some of these
                items. Each game covers different parts and eras of the same universe,
                a post-apocalyptic alternate version of out timeline, and the stories of
                those that survive. One of the currencies used in this universe, is bottle
                caps. Each bottle cap represents a cap full of water. Cap values will also be 
                listed for those that, like me, don't want to spend money on the game.

                The Fixer is a staple of the West Virginian wasteland. Medium ammo capacity,
                rapid fire rate, cheap ammo, decent range and above all, insane crit speeds.
                To translate that into English, it's a pretty good gun.

                Item's Future: Although the Fixer is an all-round great gun, it's significantly gone down
                in value over the years. It won't likely go over $15 in the future, but might be worth a good trade. 
                It was also a gift from a good friend, so I'm keeping it.

                Fasnacht is a real-life event that takes place in the small town of Helvetia, and 
            Fallout 76's developers have made it a major event of the game. Upon completion
            of the event, each participating player is given a mask, although at a very low chance, they can recieve
            a rare and cool looking mask. This is one of those, and although it offers no real-ingame
            advantages, it just looks cool, and it's rare.

                <li>Current Value: ~ $30 or 80,000 c (Gameflip)</li>
                <li>Methods of Obtaining: Bought online, traded in-game, recieved from the Fasnacht event</li>

                Item's Future: Fasnacht Masks are a volatile element of Fallout 76's market, sometimes skyrocketing
            to insane prices ($150+) or settling at a healthy medium. This mask is likely to go down,
            so I may sell it soon, just to capatilize off of the current value, and the liklihood to decrease in the near future.

                The drill is quite the interesting weapon. For years it was unable to recieve legendary effects (basically effects that severly enhance the weapon)
                and still cannot be crafted to this day. Drills were horrible weapons for the majority of 76's history,
                until automatic melee weapons got an much needed damage upgrade. These weapons are sort of like chainsaws, 
                any automatic shredding weapons, items like that.

                I've looked through many trading groups, and as far as I've found, no one has this exact drill. It's got the 
                best possible effects it can have, and I couldn't find an exact match to pricecheck it with. I personally will
                keep it, as it's a really good sidearm (as much as a literal drill can be a weapon...) and just a stupid, but fun weapon.
